**wasmX** is a next-generation modular blockchain engine where the entire protocol stack—including consensus logic and core blockchain behavior—is implemented as WebAssembly (WASM) smart contracts. This radical modularity enables full programmability and upgradability at every layer of the blockchain, empowering developers with unprecedented flexibility and control.

Build sovereign blockchains with customizable consensus and protocol rules.

Prototype or evolve blockchain designs without deep C++/Golang kernel hacking and without forks.

Interconnect applications and data across domains using email, SQL, and standard networking.

Leverage existing Ethereum assets while exploring the broader capabilities of WASM.

Use high-level scripting and visual logic to define complex behaviors like consensus without sacrificing performance or modularity.
